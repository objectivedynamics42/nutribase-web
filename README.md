## Routing
I'm not sure that routing is working as expected but specifying the full php file and the enpoint works
* The [gettags endpoint](https://objectivedynamics.co.uk/nutribase.php/getTags) works
* Similarly the [getfoods endpoint for tag 4 (fruits)](https://objectivedynamics.co.uk/nutribase.php/getFoods?tagId=4) works
* As does the [getfoods endpoint for food 15 (Greek Yoghurt)](https://objectivedynamics.co.uk/nutribase.php/getSingleFood?foodId=15)
