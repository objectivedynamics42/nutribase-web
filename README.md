## Routing
* Right now endpoints and arguments are **case sensitive**
* I'm not sure that routing is working as expected but specifying the full php file and the [gettags endpoint](https://objectivedynamics.co.uk/nutribase.php/gettags) does
* Similarly the [getfoods endpoint for tag 4 (fruits)](https://objectivedynamics.co.uk/nutribase.php/getfoods?tagid=4) works
